# ProToolsText
Text parser and CSV converter for Avid Pro Tools text exports.

Of most interest at this time is the PText Converter.app utility program...

## This project is abandonded

If you need to convert a Pro Tools text export into a document, check out my 
[ptulsconv](https://github.com/iluvcapra/ptulsconv) project. Due to certain limitations in XML processing 
in Cocoa I decided to reimplement it in Python.
